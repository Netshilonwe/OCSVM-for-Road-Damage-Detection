# OCSVM-for-Road-Damage-Detection
This notebook demonstrates the use of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM)  for detecting anomalies in road damage images. The goal is to identify unusual  patterns that may indicate cracks, potholes, or other damage that differs from  normal road surface conditions.
