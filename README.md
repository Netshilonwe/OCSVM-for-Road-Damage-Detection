# OCSVM-for-Road-Damage-Detection
This notebook demonstrates the use of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM)  for detecting anomalies in road damage images. The goal is to identify unusual  patterns that may indicate cracks, potholes, or other damage that differs from  normal road surface conditions.  
### Key Steps:
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction from images
- Training an OCSVM model
- Evaluating anomaly detection performance
- Visualizing results and flagged anomalies
